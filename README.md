# HackSRM
This project revolves around helping blind people to avoid unknown obstacles. We will try to solve this problem by making a device which will help them to detect any kind of obstacles while walking from a particular distance.
For this we are gonna use micro controler, ultrasonic sensor. 
This project is basically an application of IOT.
