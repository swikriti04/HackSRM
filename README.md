# HackSRM
This project revolves around helping blind people to avoid unknown obstacles. We will try to solve this problem by making a device which will help them to detect any kind of obstacles while walking from a particular distance.
For this we are gonna use micro controler, ultrasonic sensor. 
This project is basically an application of IOT.
We will use NodeMCU ESP8266 and Ultrasonic sensor (HC SR04)
Actually its gonna work as mentioned below:
Firt Sensor will detect an obstacle and then it will calculate the distance.After calculating the distance
