# Obstacle Detector
Think if you were a blind man, how difficult it would be for you to walk. Even if you use white cane there might be chances that you could fall or your cane gets stuck somewhere.
So this project revolves around helping blind people to avoid unknown obstacles. We will try to solve this problem by making a device which will help them to detect any kind of obstacles while walking from a particular distance.
For this we are gonna use micro controller, ultrasonic sensor. 
This project is basically an application of IOT.
We will use NodeMCU ESP8266 and Ultrasonic sensor (HC SR04)
Actually its gonna work as mentioned below:
First Sensor will detect an obstacle and then it will calculate the distance.
We are going to set a particular range.
If sensor detects anything within this range then that person will get a message on his phone and as we know that "talk back" is always turned on on their mobile phones so their mobile phone will read out that message and the person will come to know that there is some kind of obstacles in his way.
For sending message we will use IFTTT.
That's it.This was an overview of our project.
